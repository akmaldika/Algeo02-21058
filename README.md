## General Information
- The goal of this project is to implement a web or GUI that can recognize someone's face by comparing it with similar images inside the program database/dataset. 
- The SVD were calculated without any help from libraries that could calculate eigenvalues/ eigenvectors/ svd directly. 
- Students were asked to implement what they got in class by making their own code to calculate eigenvaluses, eigenvectors, and svd.

- Python 3.11.0
- numpy 1.23.4
